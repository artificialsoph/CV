# Gap CV

## Intro

**Gap** is a data engineering framework for machine learning. The **GapCV** is a component of **Gap** for computer vision (CV). The component manages data preparation of images, feeding and serving neural network models, and data management of persistent storage.

The module is written in a modern *object oriented programming (OOP)* abstraction with an *imperative programming* style that fits seamlessly into ML frameworks which are moving into imperative programming, such as **Keras** and **PyTorch**. The bottom layers of the module are written in a *bare metal* style for high performance.

**Gap** was inspired by a meeting of data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts in Portland, OR in May 2018. The first version of **Gap** was available during the summer and the local software community was engaged through meetups, chats, Kaggle groups, and a conference at the Oxford Suites. During the Fall, a decision was made to refactor **Gap** into an industrial grade application, spearheaded by Gap's lead, David Molina, and overseen and assisted by Andrew Ferlitsch, Google AI.
